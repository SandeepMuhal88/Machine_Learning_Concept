# FP-Growth Algorithm: A Guide to Association Rule Mining

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The FP-Growth algorithm is used to identify frequent itemsets in a dataset of transactions (e.g., items purchased together). The goal is to find combinations of items that frequently appear together.

## Step 2: Key Concepts

### Frequent Itemset
An itemset whose support is greater than or equal to the given minimum support threshold.

### Support
The proportion of transactions that contain a given itemset, calculated as:

\[
\text{Support}(X) = \frac{\text{Number of transactions containing } X}{\text{Total number of transactions}}
\]

### FP-tree (Frequent Pattern Tree)
A compact data structure that represents transactions in a tree format, enabling efficient mining of frequent patterns.

## Step 3: FP-Growth Algorithm Steps

### Step 3.1: Build the FP-tree
1. **Scan the database** to calculate the frequency of each item. Discard items that donâ€™t meet the minimum support threshold.
2. **Sort the remaining items** in descending order of their frequency to ensure a compact tree.
3. **Construct the FP-tree**:
    - Create a root node labeled as "null."
    - For each transaction:
      - Insert the sorted items into the tree.
      - If an item already exists in the path, increment its count.
      - Otherwise, create a new node and link it appropriately.
    - Maintain a header table to store pointers to the first occurrence of each item in the tree for efficient traversal.

### Step 3.2: Mining Frequent Patterns from the FP-tree
1. Start with the least frequent item (from the header table) as the base of a **conditional pattern base** (a sub-database for that item).
2. Extract the **conditional FP-tree**, a smaller FP-tree consisting of paths containing that item.
3. Recursively repeat this process on each conditional FP-tree until no more patterns can be generated.

### Step 3.3: Generate Frequent Itemsets
Combine items in the conditional FP-trees with the base item to generate frequent patterns.
