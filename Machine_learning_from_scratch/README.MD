1️⃣ Collect data
Images, text, numbers, audio… depends on the problem.

2️⃣ Preprocess

Clean, normalize, split into train/test.

3️⃣ Choose a model

Linear Regression

Decision Tree

Neural Network

Transformer (advanced)

4️⃣ Train the model

Model adjusts parameters to reduce error.

5️⃣ Evaluate

Test accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

6️⃣ Deploy

Serve it using FastAPI, Flask, or integrate into apps.
